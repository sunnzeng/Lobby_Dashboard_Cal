                    <p>  Suggestions are minor features / enhancements to an Open Source project.
                    Suggestions may only relate to significant technical aspects of the project (rather than processes or organisational issues).
                    Suggestions must provide all the information and details for the requested features to be actualized.
                    Images, charts, screenshots, links and examples should be included contributions to this category. </p>

                        Updates on Own Projects can be committed directly, without a Pull Request. Commits must not be older than 14 days.
                        Bug Fixes for contributor’s Own Projects will not be accepted, unless the Bugs were caused by third party dependencies.
